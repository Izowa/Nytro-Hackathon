# Project Nyaz

# Project Description

Project Nyaz is a social media styled website based off reddit, where users encouraged to post content either in the form or images or text posts and other users reward them using the NYTRO crypto system to reward users with Nya tokens. In turn these users receive xp and level up showing their commitment to the community as well as rewarding their posts to have better traction on the site. The idea is to build and assist communityâ€™s where users can directly reward the content creators that they like with something of real value and be post based. For the Nytro competition the base user accounts and post systems will be the goal, with a single core community page like reddit all. 


More Info to be release soon but development is underway and we are very keen to get you all in and using the site come August.
